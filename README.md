# dredge-cheats-terminal
A mod which enables the debug cheats terminal in Dredge

![debugconsole](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/235367741-b1b6b1f2-ab89-4ddf-944a-172137f88fc9.png)

Some good commands to try:

For using a freecam to look around the map:
debugcam (1 to enable, 0 to disable)
debugcam.fov
debugcam.fog
debugcam.maxspeed

For messing with the ocean waves:
wave.steep
wave.length
wave.speed
wave.directions

For your ship:
player.god (1 to enable, 0 to disable)
player.immune (1 to enable, 0 to disable)
player.move
player.turn

Here some of the console commands I've found, not sure what they all do tho and might be missing some. You can type "Help" into the terminal to list all of them.
If you run BepInEx with the console configured to be open you can see a list of all commands as they get added.
